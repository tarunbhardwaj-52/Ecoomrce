<h3>
    Step-by-step setup installation guide for a Django project named "ecommerce_prj." This assumes you have Python and Django already installed on your system. If not, make sure to install Python and set up a virtual environment first.
</h3>

### Step 1: Clone the Project

1. Open your command line or terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store your Django project.

3. Clone the project from a Git repository (replace `<repository_url>` with the actual repository URL) or download from link and unzip file:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url> ecommerce_prj
   ```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ecommerce_prj
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended to isolate project dependencies):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

1. Ensure you're in the project directory with the virtual environment activated.

2. Install the project dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 4: Set Up the Database

1. Create the database tables and apply migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. Create a superuser account (an admin account) by following the prompts:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

### Step 5: Run the Development Server

1. Start the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. Open your web browser and access the development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. You should see your Django project's homepage.

### Step 6: Access the Admin Panel

1. To access the admin panel, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and log in using the superuser account credentials you created earlier.

### Step 7: Start Developing

You're now set up to start developing your Django project "ecommerce_prj." You can build and customize your application by adding models, views, templates, and other components as needed.

Remember to deactivate the virtual environment when you're done working on your project:
```bash
deactivate  # On Windows
source venv/bin/deactivate  # On macOS and Linux
```

That's it! You've successfully set up and installed your Django project. Happy coding!
